synopsis: "EasyCrypt: Computer-Aided Cryptographic Proofs"
description: """
EasyCrypt is a toolset for reasoning about relational properties
of probabilistic computations with adversarial code. Its main
application is the construction and verification of game-based
cryptographic proofs."""

post-messages: """
EasyCrypt needs external provers to be installed. From opam, you
can install AltErgo (package: alt-ergo).

The required steps for configuring the provers are listed on:
