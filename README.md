EasyCrypt: Computer-Aided Cryptographic Proofs
====================================================================

EasyCrypt is a toolset for reasoning about relational properties of
probabilistic computations with adversarial code. Its main application
is the construction and verification of game-based cryptographic
proofs.

Installation requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

EasyCrypt uses the following third-party tools/libraries:

 * OCaml (>= 4.05)

     Available at http://caml.inria.fr/

 * OCamlbuild

 * Why3 (>= 1.3)

     Available at <http://why3.lri.fr/>

     Why3 must be installed with a set a provers.
     See <http://why3.lri.fr/#provers>

     Why3 libraries must be installed (make byte && make install-lib)

 * Menhir <http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/>

 * OCaml Batteries Included <http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/>

 * OCaml PCRE (>= 7) <https://github.com/mmottl/pcre-ocaml>

 * OCaml Zarith <https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/zarith>

 * OCaml ini-files <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/o/ocaml-inifiles/>

On POSIX/Win32 systems (GNU/Linux, *BSD, OS-X), we recommend that users
install EasyCrypt and all its dependencies via `opam`.

Via OPAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing requirements using OPAM 2 (POSIX systems)

Opam can be easily installed from source or via your packages manager:

  * On Ubuntu and derivatives:

      ```
      $> add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
      $> apt-get update
      $> apt-get install ocaml ocaml-native-compilers camlp4-extra opam
      ```

  * On Fedora/OpenSUSE:

      ```
      $> sudo dnf update
      $> sudo dnf install ocaml ocaml-docs ocaml-camlp4-devel opam
      ```

  * On MacOSX using brew:

      ```
      $> brew install ocaml opam
      ```

Once `opam` and `ocaml` has been successfully installed run the following:

```
$> opam init
$> eval $(opam env)
```

For any issues encountered installing `opam` see:

  * [https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html] for detailed opam installation instructions.

  * [https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html] for how to initialize opam.

You can then install all the needed dependencies via the opam OCaml
packages manager.

  0. Optionally, switch to a dedicated compiler for EasyCrypt:

      ```
      $> opam switch create easycrypt $OVERSION
      ```

      where `$OVERSION` is a valid OCaml version (e.g. ocaml-base-compiler.4.07.0)

  1. Add the EasyCrypt package from repository:

      ```
      $> opam pin -yn add easycrypt https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt.git
      ```

  2. Optionally, use opam to install the system dependencies:

      ```
      $> opam install depext
      $> opam depext easycrypt
      ```

  3. Install EasyCrypt's dependencies:

      ```
      $> opam install --deps-only easycrypt
      $> opam install alt-ergo
      ```

     If you get errors about ocamlbuild failing because it's already
     installed, the check can be skipped with the following:

      ```
      CHECK_IF_PREINSTALLED=false opam install --deps-only easycrypt
      ```

  4. You can download extra provers at the following URLs:

     * Z3: [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3]
     * CVC4: [https://cvc4.github.io/]

### Installing requirements using OPAM (non-POSIX systems)

You can install all the needed dependencies via the opam OCaml packages manager.

  1. Install the opam Ocaml packages manager, following the instructions at:

     https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/installation/

  2. Add the EasyCrypt package from repository:

      ```
      $> opam pin -yn add easycrypt https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt.git
      ```

  3. Use opam to install the system dependencies:

      ```
      $> opam install depext depext-cygwinports
      $> opam depext easycrypt
      ```

  4. Install EasyCrypt's dependencies:

      ```
      $> opam install --deps-only easycrypt
      $> opam install alt-ergo
      ```

  5. You can download extra provers at the following URLs:

     * Z3: [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3]
     * CVC4: [https://cvc4.github.io/]


Via NIX
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First, install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/) by
following [these instructions](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#chap-installation).

Then, at the root of the EasyCrypt source tree, type:

    ```
    $> nix-shell
    ```
    
These should install all the required dependencies. From there, simply
run:

    ```
    $> make
    ```
    
to compile EasyCrypt.

Configuring Why3
====================================================================

Before running EasyCrypt and after the installation/removal/update
of an SMT prover, you need to (re)configure Why3.

```
$> why3 config detect
```

EasyCrypt is using the default Why3 location, i.e. ~/.why3.conf.
If you have several versions of Why3 installed, it may be impossible
to share the same configuration file among them. EasyCrypt via the
option -why3, allows you to load a Why3 configuration file from a
custom location. For instance:

```
$> why3 config --detect -C $WHY3CONF.conf
$> ./ec.native -why3 $WHY3CONF.conf
```

where `$WHY3CONF` must be replaced by some custom location.

Note on Prover Versions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why3 and SMT solvers are independent pieces of software with their
own version-specific interactions. Obtaining a working SMT setup may
require installing specific versions of some of the provers.

At the time of writing, we depend on Why3 1.4.x, which supports the
following versions (and some versions below):

 * Alt-Ergo 2.4.0 (if you install alt-ergo using opam, you can
   prevent upgrades using `opam pin alt-ergo 2.4.0`)
 * CVC4 1.8
 * Z3 4.8.10

Installing/Compiling EasyCrypt
====================================================================

If installing from source, running

```
$> make
$> make install
```

builds and install EasyCrypt (under the binary named `easycrypt`),
assuming that all dependencies have been successfully installed. If
you choose not to install EasyCrypt system wide, you can use the
binary `ec.native` that is located at the root of the source tree.

It is possible to change the installation prefix by setting the
environment variable PREFIX:

```
$> make PREFIX=/my/prefix install
```

EasyCrypt comes also with an opam package. Running

```
$> opam install easycrypt
```

installs EasyCrypt and its dependencies via opam. In that case, the
EasyCrypt binary is named `easycrypt`.


Proof General Front-End
